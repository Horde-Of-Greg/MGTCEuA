# Mireole's GTCEu Additions
An addon mod to GregTech CEu and AE2 Unofficial Extended Life, aiming to make automating GT machines using AE2 easier

Requires [GregTech CEu](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) and [AE2UEL](https://github.com/AE2-UEL/Applied-Energistics-2)
## Features
- ME Machine Controller: A GregTech cover that works similarly to the commonly used machine controller cover + ME (Fluid) level emitter
- Advanced ME Machine Controller (planned): Same as the ME Machine Controller, but has multiple slots and support for more complex logic operations
- ME IO Cover (planned): Supplies exact amounts of items / fluids from an ME network to a GT machine. Can also import items / fluids from the output slots into the network.
- ME Interface Cover (planned): Same as the ME IO Cover, but also supports autocrafting patterns
